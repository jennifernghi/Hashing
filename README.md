# Problem on Quadratic probing
Implement MyMap using open addressing with quadratic probing
 * Create a new concrete class that implements MyMap using open addressing with quadratic probing. 
 * For simplicity, use f(key) = key % size as the hash function,
 * where size is the hash-table size. Initially, the hash-table size is 4. 
 * The table size is doubled whenever the load factor exceeds the threshold (0.5).
