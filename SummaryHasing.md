# Hashing: technique that retrives the value using the index, i, w/o performing a search
+ superefficient search, insert, delete O(1)
+ Hasing uses a hashing function to map a key to 1 index
+ map(dictionary, hash table, associative array) is a container object that stores entries
+ HashMap using hashing
+ if u can map a key to an index -> we can store the values in an array and use key as the index to find the value
+ array stores value: HASH TABLE
+ HASH FUNCTION: function that maps a key to an index in the hash table
  - hash function obtains 1 index from a key i=hash(key) and uses i to retrieve the value for the key
  - perfect hash function: a function that maps each search key to a differnt index in the hash table
  --> diificult
  collision: 2+ keys are mapped to the same hash value
+ HASH CODE: a typical hash function first converts a search key to 1 integer value called hash code; then compresses the hash code into 1 index to the hash table
  - Object class: hashCode()
      + by default, memory address returned
      + should override hashCode() whenever equals method is overridden -> 2 equal objects return same hash code.
      + during execution of a program, provided that ob's data not changed, invoking the hashCode() n times returns same integer
      + 2 !=obs may have the same hash code => to avoid, implement hashCode()
      + Hash code for primitive types:
        - byte, short, int, char ==> cast to int
        - float ==> Float.floatToIntBits(key)
        - long ==> using FOLDING: int hashCode = (int)(key ^ (key >> 32)) 
          + ">>" right-shift operator that shifts the bits 32 positions to the right
          + "^" exclusive-or operator
        - double: 
          long bits = Double.doubleToLongBits(key);
          int hashCode = (int)(bits ^ (bits >> 32));
      + String: take position of hashCode into consideration -> polinomial hash code
      + Compress Hash Codes
        - to scale the hash code down to fit in the index's range
        - h(hashCode) = hashCode % N // N is a value of power of 2
          + h(hashCode) = hashCode % N   SAME AS  h(hashCode) = hashCode & (N-1)
          + &: AND operator, faster than %
        - ensure hashing evenly distributed supplemetal hash function used along w/ primary hash function in HashMap
          + private static int supplementalHash(int h) {
          
              h ^= (h >>> 20) ^ (h >>> 12);
              
              return h ^ (h >>> 7) ^ (h >>> 4);
              
            } 
          + ==> h(hashCode) = supplementalHash(hashCode) % N  SAME AS  h(hashCode) = supplementalHash(hashCode) & (N -1)
        - BITWISE OPERATIONS ARE MUCH FASTER THAN MULTIPLICATION, DIVISION, REMAINDER OPERATION
+ Collision occures when 2 keys are mapped to the same index in a hash table
  - 2 ways for handling collisions: open addressing and seperate chaining
    + OPEN ADDRESSING: prcess of finding 1 open location in the hash table in the event of a collision
        1. LINEAR PROBING 1++
           - when collision occurs during the insertion of an entry to a hash table, linear probing findsthe next available location sequentially
           - index = key % N where N is prime
           - ex: if collision occurs at hashTable[k % N], then check hashTable[(k+1) % N]. If not, check hashTable[(k+2) % N]
           - when probing reaches the end of the table, it goes back at the beginning of the table => hash table treated as if it were circular
           - search: obtain index: k from hash function for the key. check hashTable[k % N] contains the entry. If not check hashTable[(k+1) % N] ...until it is found or 1 empty cell reached
           - remove: search the entry matches the key. I found, place a special MARKER to denote that the entry is available
              + each cell in hash table has 3 possible states: occupied, marked, empty
              + marked: available for insertion
           - ==> DISADVANTAGE: linear probing tends to cause groups of consecutive cells in hash table to be occupied. Each group called CLUSTER. Each cluster: a probe sequence that must search when retrieving, add, remove 1 entry. as cluster grows in size, they may merge into even larger clusters --> further slowing down the search time
           - ==> GUARANTEE: 1 available cell can be found for insertion as long as the table is not full
        2. QUADRATIC PROBING j^2 ++
           - avoid clustering problem in linear probing
           - look for cells at indeces (k + j^2) % N for j>=0, that is, k % N, (k+1) % N, (k+4) % N, (k+9) %N and ...
           - ==> DISADVANTAGE: SECONDARY CLUSTERING: entries that collide w/ anoccupied entry use the same probe sequence
        3. DOUBLE HASHING
           - avoid clustering problem
           - use a secondary hash function h'(key) to determine increments
           - look at cells at indices (k + j*h'(key)) % N, for j >=0, that is, k% N, (k +h'(key)) % N, (k + 2h'(key)) % N, (k + 3h'(key)) % N ...
           - Secondary hash function h'(key) = q âˆ’ (key % q) where q < N and q is prime
           - ex: h(key) = key % 11;  h'(key) = 7 - (key % 7);
    + HANDLNG COLLISIONS USING SEPARATE CHAINING places all entries w/ the same hash index insame location, rather than finding new locations. Each location in the separate chaining uses a bucket to hold multiple entries
      - implement a bucket using array, arraylist, linkedlist
+ LOAD FACTOR AND REHASHING
  - load factor (lamda) measures how full a hash table is: ratio of #of elements to the size of hash table
      + lamda = n/N where n: # of elements; N: # of locations in the hash table
      + lamda = 0 --> hash table is empty
      + lamda =1 --> hash table is full
      + open addressing scheme 0<= lamda <=1 =>> should maintain lamda < 0.5
      + chaining scheme: as lamda increase, probability increases ==>> should maintain lamda< 0.9
      + HashMap lamda = 0.75. when lamda exceeded, u should increase hash table size and rehash all the entries in the map into a new larger hash table. ==> double the hash table size to reduce of rehashing. 
  - rehashing: if load factor exceeded, increas has-table size and reload entries into a new larger hash table
+IMPLEMENT A MAP USING HASHING
  - 2^N <=>  1 << N; EX: 1<<30 <=> 2^30
